        <p>I am a composer, performer, and educator based in Queens, NY. I compose chamber music and theater music, 
            and perform on keyboards, synthesizers, mallet percussion, and drums. I regularly collaborate with the 
            following projects: <br> <br>
             <a>ShoutHouse</a>, an ensemble of musicians from classical, hip-hop, and jazz backgrounds. I have composed and arranged several works for ShoutHouse, and perform with them on synth, keyboards, and mallet percussion; <br>
             <a>LCollective</a>, a performance group that explores permeable music. I have composed 
             works for and with LCollective including scroll 1 and 2, boards, chimes, and wheel;<br>
             <a>a glassy ruckus</a>, my metallophone-forward chamber/folk/improv ensemble. I compose music and words for this group and perform on a multiple percussion set-up including glockenspiel and loose vibraphone bars; <br>
             <a>Zamler-Carhart/Rauh/Greenberg</a>, an improvisational trio exploring ancient texts, modren poetry, and 
             and the words of the troubadours, all in their original languages including Occitane, Byzantine Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and Dutch; <br>
             <a>Trusty Sidekick Theater Company</a>, a children's theater company. I composed music for their recent outdoor show A Perfect Party for Trees, and performed on glockenspiel and small percussion. The show was made specifically for young audiences on the autism spectrum and for neurodiverse audiences in general; <br>
             <a>Naeemah Maddox</a>, vocalist/guitarist/flutist/composer. I play keyboards in her band by the same name; <br> 
             <a>Circus Dreams</a>, a life-long musical collaboration with my dad; <br>
             I also perform as a <a>solo artist</a>, often combining multiple percussion instruments, original compositions, and arrangements;<br>
             </p>
        <p>Recent compositional work includes music for the Trusty Sidekick Theater Company's A Perfect Party 
            for Trees, which premiered in September 2022 at Little Island's Storytelling Festival and was 
            featured in the New York Times. Additional performances are planned for June 2023 at the New 
            York State Puppet Festival in Perry, NY. Original compositions and performances can also 
            be heard on Evidence, Boards Guitar (Love Records, 2021), mots ricos (Composers 
            Concordance/Naxos, 2020), and Cityscapes (New Amsterdam Records, 2018).</p>

        </p>
        <p>For the past ten years I have also worked as an arts educator and an early childhood teacher.
            I have taught grade-school level music at public schools in Queens, the Bronx, and Manhattan, and 
            teach piano, percussion, and composition/theory lessons. I enjoy working with students of all ages,
            including adult students.

        <p>I have done teaching artist wor throughout NYC's public schools with 
            92nd Street Y and the Trusty Sidekick Theater Company. As a visiting 
            artist, I have introduced music to hundreds of students, often through 
            the lenses of world percussion and exploration of sound. 
        <P>As a private instructor, I offer lessons in percussion, 
            piano/keyboa<span class="overdark">rds,</span> composition, and music 
            theory. Lessons are structured around the student's goals, preferences, 
            and curiosities. I will make piano arrangements of student's favorite 
            songs for their particular skill level. When possible I aim to mix 
            composition and improvisation into my instrumental instruction.</P>
        <p>I welcome students of all ages.</p>
